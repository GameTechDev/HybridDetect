    \file TaskMgrCRT.h

    TaskMgrTbb is a class that wraps the CRT library with a C-style handle and 
    callback mechanism for scheduling tasks to scale across any number of CPU
    cores.

    TaskMgrCRT is a singleton object and is already instantiated for the app as
    gTaskMgr.  The TaskMgrCRT is single threaded, meaning that tasksets can only
    be created from one thread.  With minor changes and some performance loss,
    multiple thread can create task sets (see AllocateTaskSet in TaskMgrTbb.cpp. 
    The app can control two knobs in the TaskMgrTbb class through MAX_SUCCESSORS 
    and MAX_TASKSETS defined below.

    MAX_SUCCESSORS is the maximum number of tasksets that can be have depended
    on another taskset.  For example if you have Tasksets A,B,C and both B and 
    C can run simultaniously and both depend on A to complete (so A->(B,C)) then
    A has two successors.  There is a small performance hit for large numbers
    of successors so the value should be set to something reasonably close to 
    the maximum the app will use. The default value is 5.

    MAX_TASKSETS is the max number of tasksets that can be live at one  time. 
    A taskset is live if it has a non-zero reference count.  Increasing the 
    number of tasksets that can be live increases the memory footprint of the 
    TaskMgrTbb object.  The default value is 255.
